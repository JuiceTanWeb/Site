  <center><h1>Welcome to the Plant Camp Animal Care Class!</h1>
  <div class = "hr"></div>
<p>Animal care is very important.  If you have not had any animal care class before, DON'T touch any animal in Plant Camp.  If you do not know how to care for them they may bite or scratch you.
  <br>
This Bronze Animal Care class is very important.  It's your first Animal Care class.  
<br>
<br> LESSON 1: INTRO TO BIRDS
<br>
We'll start with birds.  Rareley any Plant Witches own birds, but if you do you'll need to know how to catch one.  Start out maybe sprinkling bird food somewhere, or put a bird feeder on a tree.  Once 
<br>there's a bird there, don't do anything and be as quiet as you could.  When catching, ONLY use Plant Camp bird catchers.  Don't use anything else like nets, that'll just scare the bird away.  
<br>Plant Camp bird catchers are more easy to use and tested.  Once you got your catcher, slowly creep towards the bird.  Open up the catcher and scoop the bird up inside.  You caught it!  If this<br>didn't work, next time try to add a little bit of bird food in the catcher.  
<br>
Next. you'll need to know how to care for your bird.  A suggested cage is one that is large and made with sturdy wood, mining wood recommended. If the bird you caught is a woodpecker or similar, 
<br>you'll need a nice metal or rock cage.  Do not make it yourself, ask a smith to make it for you. A good feeding bowl for birds are lime or leaf plated bowls, again if you have a woodpecker a <br>different material is recommended.  A yummy and healthy meal for most birds are crushed mining nuts, truffle nuts, and maple seed.  This is good for most types of birds, though if you have a Treebird <br>sparrow, a Leafy featherwing, or a Aqua pecker ask a professional for the best type of food for them, since they have different bodies than other kinds of birds. You should add something that a <br>bird might like in their cage, such as sticks against the wall of the cage, or fake nests. 
<br>If you want to take care of a bird properly, you will also have to learn a little about them too.  There are many different kinds of bird.  Birds are sorted in to categories.  For example, one of the categories is "simple".  Thes are birds that are easy to take care of, and are common around most parts of Earth Island.  Some examples of birds in the simple category may include the Crow and Pigeon. Like I said, these birds are common.  The food they eat is common too.  It isn't anything complicated you would have to ask a professional about. What they eat many include table scrap, wheat seeds, mining nuts and blackberry seed.  
<br> Another bird type is "hemidemisemiquaver".  Sounds complicated. correct?  Well. that's what these birds are.  Birds in the hemidemisemiquaver category have more vibrant and detailed feathers then other birds in different categories.  Remember when I said that the Treebird sparrow, the Leafy featherwing, and the Aqua pecker have different diets then most of the other birds?  I was saying that actually ALL the birds in this category have strange diets.  It's best if you question a professional what to feed your hemisemidemiquaver bird before giving it a few tasty seeds. Also, I am warning you; if you are a first-time bird owner, I recommend to not get a hemisemidemiquaver bird.  These birds tend to be a little more aggresive than other birds.  Hemidemisemiquaver birds are also a little rarer, you could win money if you sucessfully catch one, especially birds like the Gates pigeon, Oceanpearl soarer, Cornstalk chirpey, and the deadly Little State Beakprey.    
<br> The last category I'll be listing today is the Arinfinto category.  These are mostly large and flightless birds.  Some examples of Arinfinto birds inculde the Leafy ostrich, the Weedland flamingo, and the Music kiwi.  These birds have about the same diets of birds in the simple category, but if you have any type of flamingo you would have to feed it shrimp or something similar. Penguins, such as the Tomato Rockhopper and the Weedland King will have to be fed fish. Large, flightless birds in the Arinfinto category most likely will not need a cage, but do so if it is aggresive or of a professional tells you to. 
<br>
<br>Lesson 1 activities and questions
<br>
<br>1. Read the questions below.  Discuss with your tablemates the answer to each question.  Be prepared to share.
<br> a) What is one bird that is in the simple category? 
<br> b) Are hemidemisemiquaver birds more rare than simple birds?
<br> c) Arinfinto birds most likely do not need _____.
<br> d) Name one thing you should not use to catch a bird. 
<br> e) Is it safe to let a woodpecker be in a wood cage?
<br> f) Name one bird in the hemisemidemiquaver category.
<br>
<br> 2. Activity.
<br> Your teacher will give you some cards.  Some of them are blue, the other ones are green.  They will all have words on them, blue ones saying the categories, and green ones saying the bird names. Stack each green card on top of the correct blue card to sort the birds out. 
<br>
<br> 3.  Discuss. 
<br> Answer this question with your tablemates: What makes each and every category different and unique from the others?  Deeply explain, and add detail in your response.
<br>

<br> LESSON 2: INTRO TO CATS
<br>
<br>Cats are some of the largest animals you can take care of in Plant Camp, but some are hard to take are of. In this lesson, you'll learn about the different types of cat living here. 
<br>
<br>Catching a cat is usually easier then catching birds.  That's because they don't fly away, although they can run very fast, faster than a Plant Witch on a broom!  So lets's start.  As you may already know, cats don't actually step inside of Plant Camp.  They hand out around the borders, so you won't be able to catch one of it jumps into another state.  Unlike catching a bird, you pet it.  Pet it as long as you want.  The reason for petting it is because you want the cat to feel safe around you. Once it feels comfortable, it is safe to pick the cat up. If it hisses at you, try agin by petting it more.  You can even give the cat some food to bribe them.  Repeat these steps until it is safe to carry it into your house. 
<br> You may be wondering how to take care of a cat.  Cats usually prefer normal Plant houses, but living in the hotel is fine too.  They prefer normal houses over hotel rooms because hotel rooms have louder sound, and that can scare them sometimes.  Anyways, moving on.  Cats eat meat, but PLant Camp dosent have any.  That's why to take care of a cat is pretty expensive.  You will have to buy meat that is exported from other states or countries, and that might not be the cheapest.  The main and best producers or land meat includes Music, Neptune, and Little state, and the best producers of seafood include Aqua and Oceanpearl.
