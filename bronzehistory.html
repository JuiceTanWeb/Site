  <center><h1>Welcome to the Plant Camp History Class!</h1>
  <div class = "hr"></div>
<p> Over the cource of several minutes, you will learn the basics of Plant Camp history.</p>
<br>
<p> Let's begin! The first major event in Plant Camp history is when Jessica started it in year 0. She was an orphan from treebird when she moved here and began Plant Camp.</p>
<br>
<p>Another major event was when Hero of Plant Camp joined, in year 25. There were about 25 people in Plant Camp. At that point, Plant camp wasn't a safe place to live. Monsters from monslunch regularly invaded the place and looted homes. Hero of Plant Camp was an archer from oceanpearl. She was able to defend the small group from monsters and save the day. This was one of the crucial points in history and what made Plant Camp very prosperous.</p>
<br>
<p>The metro came in existence after professor plant invented it in year 30. This buisness has since been run by Justin, a greedy dirtbag.</p>
<br>
<p>Planman and Plana joined in year 34. With the help of their friends, they managed to get rid of the ufos during year 37, 41, and 42.</p>
<br>
<p>The mining hole began operations in year 35 and continued to operate until year 40, then started up again in 42, and fell in year 44.</p>
<br>
<p>Succulent central was opened in year 39. It helped introduce plant camp to many exotic plants, and houses many historical objects.</p>
<br>
<p>In year 40, an exiting communication system 
<p>The first coins began to be produced in year 45, or 2018. They helped make trade better and make cash last longer.</p>
